GHB is a central nervous system depressant used as an intoxicant. It has many
street names. Its effects have been described anecdotally as comparable with
ethanol (alcohol) and MDMA use, such as euphoria, disinhibition, enhanced
libido and empathogenic states. At higher doses, GHB may induce nausea,
dizziness, drowsiness, agitation, visual disturbances, depressed breathing,
amnesia, unconsciousness, and death. One potential cause of death from GHB
consumption is polydrug toxicity. Co-administration with other CNS depressants
such as alcohol or benzodiazepines can result in an additive effect
(potentiation), as they all bind to gamma-aminobutyric acid (or GABA) receptor
sites. The effects of GHB can last from 1.5 to 4 hours, or longer if large
doses have been consumed. Consuming GHB with alcohol can cause respiratory
arrest and vomiting in combination with unrousable sleep, which can contribute
to a lethal outcome
