An 80% indica strain from Bulldog Seeds in the Netherlands, Bubblegum Kush is
a cross between Bubble Gum and an undisclosed Kush. An easy-to-grow plant that
produces huge yields of frosty, resinous buds, it is popular with growers and
hash-makers alike. Bubblegum Kush has a sour smell and flavor, and with a THC
content in the 18% range, this indica will leave users fully relaxed and glued
to the couch.
