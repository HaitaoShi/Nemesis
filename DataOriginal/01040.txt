Generic Viagra Sildenafil 50mg Cenforce  
  
Sildenafil, sold under the brand name Viagra among others, is a medication
used to treat erectile dysfunction and pulmonary arterial hypertension. It is
unclear if it is effective for treating sexual dysfunction in women. It is
taken by mouth or by injection into a vein. Onset is typically within 20
minutes and lasts for about 2 hours. Common side effects include headaches,
heartburn, and flushed skin. Caution is advised in those with cardiovascular
disease. Rare but serious side effects include a prolonged erection that can
lead to damage to the penis, vision problems, and hearing loss. Sildenafil
should not be taken by people on nitrates such as nitroglycerin, as this may
result in a serious drop in blood pressure. Sildenafil should not be taken
within four hours of taking an alpha one antagonist. Sildenafil acts by
blocking phosphodiesterase 5, an enzyme that promotes breakdown of cGMP, which
regulates blood flow in the penis. It requires sexual arousal, however, to
work.
