Loaris Trojan Remover analyzes your PC for malware and other threats,
including some installed or left behind by other security software. It's a
premium tool that goes head-to-head with some highly respected freeware, and
its deep scans tend to find PUPs (potentially unwanted programs) and other
mild threats that other tools ignore.  
  
PUPs: Loaris Trojan Remover flagged PUPs that freeware scanners often ignore.
While not viruses, some are nuisances and can even threaten your privacy. You
don't need them, and Loaris removes them.  
  
Scan depth: System cleaners either scan lightly (first, do no harm) or deeply
(when in doubt, throw it out). Loaris Trojan Remover scrubs a bit harder,
though it means paying closer attention to scan results.  
  
Reset tools: Additional tools can reset your Web browser, Windows HOSTS files,
and Windows Update policies, when malware corrupts them.  
  
Registry cleanup: Loaris Trojan Remover also cleans the residue of malware and
other deleted items from the Windows Registry.
