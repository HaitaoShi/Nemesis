Mimosa is a hybrid marijuana strain made by crossing Clementine with Purple
Punch. In small doses, this strain produces happy, level-headed effects that
will leave you feeling uplifted and motivated enough to take on any mundane
task. In large doses, Mimosa may make you feel sleepy and relaxed. This strain
has a strong aroma and flavor that reminds you of its namesake - with notes of
fruit and citrus flavors bursting through. Medical marijuana patients choose
this strain to help relieve symptoms associated with depression and stress.
Mimosa is a rising star in the cannabis community, so don't pass up an
opportunity to enjoy this special strain.
