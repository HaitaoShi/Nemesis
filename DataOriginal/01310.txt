FOR GENERAL CARDING INFORMATIONS PLEASE READ MY PROFILE BIO DESCRIPTION  
  
1\. I am selling 100 % live cards with balance on them. The thing you must
understand is that many times people think that problem is in their card, not
in their skills.  
  
Many cards sold here on Darknet are LIVE with decent amounts on them. People
just struggle to card the right way or dont have the right strategy and
carding setup for a specific site they are aiming.  
  
And knowing how many beginners are considering themselves to be professionals,
nobody is blaming their skills, because its easier to blame cards.  
  
But on the other hand, here also are sold used cards, refurbished, and thats
why im coming with this listing, to give you a 100 % working card.  
  
2\. I suggest to not go for more than 7-10 % from the balance available in one
transaction. 10 % is the maximum limit i recommend, better less. Again, if you
are not a beginner, you know that big transactions trigger bank antifraud
systems and they cancel your card and call the card holder, especially if
cardholder makes online payments very rare. If on card is only 3500 $
available credit for example, than you can go for a 600-700 $ transaction  
which is more than 10 %. But if on cards are 50k $, a 5000 $ purchase may kill
the card. Hope you get the idea.  
  
WHEN YOU ORDER AND PAY FOR THIS LISTING YOU AGREE TO MY TERMS THAT I AM
STATING IN REFUND POLICY

and send us link for download. Be sure, we can clearly see that you make
correct network setup and payment was still declined.  
  
After receive, you have 24 hours to ask for replacement, in case CC is dead.

What is Carding?  
  
  
  
CC Carding is an art or technique to buy something from online shopping site
for free and as such, expect to fail a few times while you are getting
started. The key to being successful is to not give up and keep trying
different sites, methods etc. Most carders have endured tireless periods of
trial and error which is how they eventually came upon specific methods that
work for them.  
  
  
  
The resources and techniques mentioned in this tutorial are NOT the only
methods of carding. Earn the experience and try many times with different ways
and you'll get a success. This tutorial is meant to get you on your way and
helps you to get base knowledge about carding.  
  
The Basic Things Need For Carding:  
  
  
  
1\. Computer  
  
2\. Socks (Compulsory U may here to use VPN in carding. But it is a piece of
shit)  
  
3\. Mac Address Changer (Must Use)  
  
4\. All in one cleaner (CCleaner)  
  
5\. RDP (OptionalBut I prefer it for safety)  
  
6\. Drop (Optional But need to use for more secure shopping sites)  
  
7\. Credit Card (CC)  
  
  
  
Let's Explain how these requirements works and helps you in carding:  
  
  
  
1\. Computer:  
  
For carding we recommend to use a Computer or laptop. You may see many carder
using mobile. But it is not as safe as Computer but you can use independent
mobile. If you dont have PC we will describe you the safest way of carding
with mobile.  
  
  
  
2\. Socks  
  
Socks 5 SOCKet Secure (SOCKS) is an Internet protocol that routes network
packets between a client and server through a proxy server. So using this you
can hide your IP and to mach our location same with Credit Card holder
Location to make a successful transaction. Its dont leak your DNS info but
often VPN do that so it is more secure than any VPN software. An Internet
Protocol address (IP address) is a numerical label assigned to each device
connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for
communication so you must hide it.  
  
  
  
3\. MAC Address Change  
  
MAC (Media Access Control) is a unique identifier assigned to network
interfaces for communications on the physical network segment. A network node
may have multiple NICs and each NIC must have a unique MAC address. MAC
Address Changer allows you to change (spoof) Media Access Control (MAC)
Address of your Network Interface Card (NIC) instantly. You may dont
understand it. Its like your iP address. We will change it to stay anonymous
and safe.  
  
  
  
4\. CCleaner  
  
CCleaner is a very handy tool to clean your browsing history (temporary files,
cookies and also your Flash cookies, which many people neglect or dont even
know about. Flash cookies are stealthier than regular cookies. Flash can
install cookies on your computer without your permission by default, and store
the same info that regular cookies do (when you visited etc).  
  
  
  
5\. RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol)  
  
RDP is a proprietary protocol developed by Microsoft, which provides a user
with a graphical interface to connect to another computer over a network
connection. The user employs RDP client software for this purpose, while the
other computer must run RDP server software. It will connect you with any
computer that is located in other country. We use it for stay anonymous and
safe. In one word you will use someones pc for carding instead of your own.  
  
  
  
Note: you can use good VPN and PC or Phone not associated with you, e.x.
bought for cash somewhere. Use mobile internet with SIM not registered to you.
Don't forget to change PC, mobile modem and SIM.  
  
  
  
6\. Drop  
  
Drop is an address which you use for shipping address in carding. If you doing
carding with a USA CC, if you use a USA address as shipping address then order
will ship 100% you will be safe. So we have to manage USA address. If we have
friends or relatives then no problem. Otherwise there is lots of website that
give drop service. We will order to the drop address. This website will
receive our products and will send us the order. They will take a bit charge
for it. No need for every shopping site. For security with good security only.  
  
  
  
7\. Credit Card (CC)  
  
Read it carefully. This is the main part of carding. As fast as you understand
it, as fast you will be succeeded. When you buy CC from shop or somewhere
else. It will be presented in a format like below:  
  
  
  
credit card number exp date cvv2 code name on the card address city state
country zip code phone # email (phone # and email sometimes not included )  
  
  
  
For Example:  
  
4514011643654210*429*09/2018*JOHN WILD**2506344260***VISA*INFINITE*ROYAL BANK
OF CANADA*CREDIT*CAN*v2n6j5*Prince Georgee*CA 9980 Haldi rd  
  
  
  
  
  
What is BIN (Bank Identification Number)  
  
The first 6 numbers of CC is the BIN number.  
  
So from the above example the bin is 486236  
  
  
  
  
  
Let's find out what is VBV / NON VBV / MSC  
  
  
  
VBV(Verified by Visa)  
  
Extra verification process initially added by visa, there are different types
of authentication used, most notably would be a password, date of birth,
social security number, or mothers maiden name. Will send OTP to CC owner
mobile No. or need secret Password when doing transaction in any process.  
  
  
  
NON VBV(Verified by Visa)  
  
Easy to use. No need of more info about CC like DOB, SSN, MMN. Also no need
OTP when doing transaction.  
  
  
  
MSC (Mastercard Secure Code)  
  
As same as VBV We always buy NON VBV CC for carding. Cause the shopping site
is VBV or NON VBV we dont care, we have NON VBV CC. So no OTP, no AVS, no need
SSN etc. NON VBV is not verifired by visa card, you can buy anything with non
vbv cards without going through 3rd verification process. How to Buy NON VBV
CC will explain later..  
  
  
  
AVS (Address Verification System)  
  
A system used to verify the identity of the person claiming to own the credit
card. The system will check the billing address of the credit card provided by
the user with the address on file at the credit card company. This was an
attempt to help identity theft and fraud over the internet. This is a system
we as carders dont have to worry about since we have the billing address of
the credit card holder. I mentioned it since it is good to be aware of it and
that almost every site has this system. It emplifies the importance of typing
in the address correctly.  
  
  
  
Now you know enough to do your first carding.  
  
  
  
Let's start  
  
Before starting gather your all equipments:  
  
  
  
Credit Card, Socks5 matching with CC owner address, CCleaner Software, MAC
address changer software, High Speed internet.  
  
  
  
  
  
How to set socks in Mozilla Firefox:  
  
  
  
  
  
Run firefox Go to Options click on Advanced setting Network  
  
Now the screen will pop up with various options like : 1. No proxy 2.Auto
Detect 3.Use system proxy 4. Manual proxy configuration. You mark 4. Manual
proxy configuration. Now type in socks host IP you have,  
  
  
  
For example Socks Host Setup:  
  
  
  
proxy setup  
  
  
  
Press ok and restart firefox. Now you are connected to secure socks5.  
  
When you buy SOCKS, it should always match with card holder address. For
example If CC holder from Newberry, South Calorina, MA, USA then you also buy
socks with same address. Atleast matching State, Country.  
  
How to card:  
  
  
  
1\. Make a email (gmail, hotmail, etc.) with CC matching name. For example If
CC name is John Wild then make like johnwild1979gmail  
  
  
  
2\. Run Remote Desktop Connection and connect with your RDP Host. If u dont
use rdp then do the following steps in your pc.  
  
  
  
3\. Run MAC address changer, change all MAC address.  
  
  
  
4\. Run CCleaner. Analyze and clean.  
  
  
  
5\. Set socks5 in Mozzila firefox. It was explained how to do it above.  
  
  
  
6\. Restart Firefox and got o check2ip and check your ip is blacklisted or not
and as same as CC holder address.  
  
  
  
7\. Now open shopping site. We want to recommend a website shop from your
country. Why? Because you dont need to wait a lot for your order to be
shipped.  
  
  
  
8\. Register with credit card holder information, name, country, city,
address, and email you made one just for this order.  
  
  
  
9\. Choose your item and add it to cart. Never choose big amount at start.  
  
  
  
Try to card small amount item first within not more than $500.  
  
  
  
10\. In shipping address enter your address or your drop address, where you
want to deliver product.  
  
  
  
11.Go to payment page, choose Credit Card as payment method  
  
  
  
12.Enter your CC details. Dont copy-paste info. Type it one by one. Because
most of sites have a copy-paste detector script.  
  
  
  
13\. Enter CC holder address into Billing address. Now proceed to payment.  
  
  
  
14\. We are sure if you do everything right then order will be successfully
placed.  
  
  
  
15\. Wait for order to arrive to your shipping address. When they will deliver
the courier boy will call you. They ask for any ID card. If you can make a
fake ID card then good. Otherwise show your any ID card (Adhar Card, Voter ID,
College ID card).  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Basic reqirements for carding from Mobile :  
  
  
  
1\. Mobile must be rooted. (offcourse ew recommend any Android smartphone)  
  
  
  
2\. You must install few apps : IMEI changer, Phone ID changer, Android ID
changer, Proxy Droid, CCleaner  
  
  
  
3\. You can use HMA VPN for carding in mobile.  
  
  
  
4\. You use SOCK5 proxy with Proxy Droid apps.  
  
  
  
5\. You must change IMEI, Android ID etc evrything before starting carding.  
  
  
  
6\. Now connect proxy droid with SOCKS5 proxy and connect it.  
  
  
  
7\. Now follow all steps of carding that mentioned above  
  
  
  
Ok, so you got your cc, your drop and try to be anonymous as you can make
yourself.  
  
  
  
Now what sites are cardable?  
  
  
  
THE ANSWER IS: ANY AND ALL SITES ARE CARDABLE  
  
  
  
Why do We say that? because its true. Whatever you card, make sure that you
have all your info prepared before carding it. If you dont get success first
time then you have to use other BIN CC and Others Method. Have use your brain
find different Logic for different site. You may Kill 2-3 CC's when trying any
sites. But you will find out the working method for any site.
