HQ NEEDLE KETAMINE S-ISOMER SHARDS  
  
Ketamine is a medication primarily used for starting and maintaining
anesthesia. It induces dissociative anesthesia, a trance-like state providing
pain relief, sedation, and amnesia. The distinguishing features of ketamine
anesthesia are preserved breathing and airway reflexes, stimulated heart
function with increased blood pressure, and moderate bronchodilation. At
lower, sub-anesthetic doses, ketamine is a promising agent for pain and
treatment resistant depression.
