This virus encrypts stored data (video, audio, etc.) and renames encrypted
files using the "random_characters.L0cked" pattern (e.g., "sample.jpg" might
be renamed to "gd&=AA0fgoi.L0cked"). Following successful encryption,
HiddenTear opens a pop-up window containing ransom-demand message.  
  
HiddenTear's message informs victims of the encryption and demands money in
Bitcoins for decryption. The ransom payment must be made within 48 hours,
otherwise the encrypted files will supposedly be deleted. It is currently
unknown whether HiddenTear uses symmetric or asymmetric cryptography. In any
case, decryption without a unique key is impossible.  
  
The key is stored on a remote server controlled by attacker, who attempt to
blackmail victims by making ransom demands.
