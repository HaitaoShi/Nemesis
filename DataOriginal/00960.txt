I have a 12 word Mnemonic aswell as the private key for a wallet containing
$170 000 USDT ERC20 coin.  
  
The reason for selling is because I don't know how to cash this out as there
is a sma4t contract attached which transfers the GAS fees out. So you need to
find a way to cash this out with external ETH or a gasless wallet or stake it
somewhere for profit etc. There's alot that can be done here.

Can you try to explain this a little more clearly please. How is a smart
contract attached to a wallet, or better yet, what type of wallet is it?
Ledger, MetaMask, Opera, Trust, etc? Im interested in the lising but I am not
clear on what is being described and i have a fairly thorough understanding of
smart contracts and crypto related items. thanks.
