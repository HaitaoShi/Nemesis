POWER PLANT XL AUTOFLOWERING:  
  
FIRST-CLASS HAZE PAIRED WITH FRUITY AROMA  
  
The autoflowering Power Plant XL is one of these formidable autoflowers that
really deserves to carry the “XL” in her name. Although this super-productive
plant won’t likely exceed 90cm when she grows, she’ll bring a whopping 400g/m²
of Sativa goodness to the table and she does it in only 8-9 weeks from seed to
harvest. Or said differently, she *really* is a power plant among cannabis if
there was ever such a thing!  
  
Power Plant XL Autoflowering is a cross between a Super Silver Haze and
Bubblegum which doesn’t mean less than that you’ll get an authentic Haze
smoking experience but paired with the awesome fruity flavour of the
Bubblegum. Now let's also add some Ruderalis to make it an autoflower, and you
get an outstanding Sativa that’s also extremely easy to grow, and this is
actually remarkable since Hazes are otherwise not exactly the easiest strains
to grow.  
  
Along with the rich, fruity and spicy aroma that she got with the mix of Haze
and Bubblegum genetics, Power Plant XL Autoflowering makes for a clear, yet
very powerful physical effect that is positive and optimistic. This is a great
“upper strain” that will lift your mood and put a smile on your face as soon
as you take a hit. Just try her, you won't be disappointed!
