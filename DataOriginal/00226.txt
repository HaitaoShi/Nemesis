** What is sms flood and what is it for?  
Using the sms flood, you can send the specified sms # within the specified
time. Thanks to this, any undesirable message that should come to the device
is lost in the thousands sent and no one will see it. All calls originate from
randomized “hidden numbers” and (as far as I know) there’s currently no
possible way to block sms except if you use the airplane mode option. This
service is anonymous, professional and very effective. Order minimum # if
you’d like to test it.  
  
The target will get inundated with calls to the extent that they simply can’t
cope and have to turn their phone off or contacting the service provider
trying to understand what’s going on? Imagine getting thousands of calls a day
over and over again day after day. Just let that sink in. Fuck yeah!!!!  
  
Additional quantity  
Order 2 = 3k calls (50hrs)  
Order 3 = 5k calls (65hrs)  
Order 4 = 7k calls (80hrs)  
Order 5 = 9k calls (99hrs)
