ATTENTION!  
I RECOMMEND YOU TO RUN THIS SOFTWARE ON VIRTUAL PC!!!  
  
Jigsaw Ransomware message informs victims of the encryption and demands money
in Bitcoins for decryption.  
  
Once the ransomware is executed, the user is greeted by an image of Billy, and
the ransom note.  
  
The message comes in two languages; English or Portuguese. The note introduces
the idea of exponential growth, and applies it on the user’s file and the
ransom amount. Recent crypto-ransomware families have ransom amounts that grow
as time passes, but not with the same increments as JIGSAW. To make matters
worse, it deletes a larger amount of files with every hour while the amount to
be paid also increases.  
  
JIGSAW deletes files and increases the ransom amount per hour. And with the
exponential increase of files being permanently deleted, users may be
pressured into paying the ransom so they may either save the remaining files,
or avoid paying a larger ransom. The least amount the user can pay is
US$20-150 .  
  
JIGSAW is the first crypto-ransomware with a routine that creates a copy of
all the user’s files, encrypts the copies into .fun files, and deletes the
original. Some of its variants, however, changed the file extensions into
.KKK, .BTC, and .GWS files. It encrypts more than 60 file types
