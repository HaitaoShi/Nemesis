It is the first ever ransomware that misusing Android accessibility services,
it can change device’s PIN to prevent users from accessing the device and also
it encrypts all the files in the device and put a ransom note.  
  
DoubleLocker distributed through fake flash popup via the compromised
websites. Once the application triggered it launches a malware access service
dubbed as Google Play Service, then it obtains accessibility permissions.  
  
With the accessibility permissions, it obtains admin rights and the set’s up a
default home application without user’s knowledge.  
  
Setting itself as a default home app – a launcher – is a trick that improves
the malware’s persistence. Whenever the user clicks on the home button, the
ransomware gets activated and the device gets locked again. Thanks to using
the accessibility service, the user doesn’t know that they launch malware by
hitting Home  
  
Once the ransomware is executed it first change the device PIN to a random one
to block user access and then it encrypts the file with AES algorithm and
appends extension.  
  
The encryption is implemented properly, which means that, unfortunately, there
is no way to recover the files without receiving the encryption key from the
attackers.  
  
Locker demands ransom BTC payment and it should be paid within 24hours
otherwise all files will be deleted
