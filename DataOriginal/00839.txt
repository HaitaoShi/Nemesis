Flubromazepam is a benzodiazepine derivative which was first synthesized in
1960, but was never marketed and did not receive any further attention or
study until late 2012 when it appeared on the grey market as a novel designer
drug. It is a structural kind of phenazepam in which the chlorine atom has
been replaced by a fluorine atom
