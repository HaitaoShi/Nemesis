🌟 🌝 ✨ MC OG 🌟 🌝 ✨  
Indica Dominant Hybrid - 80% Indica / 20% Indica THC: 21%  
  
Recently on a sunny farm in the Golden (Stoner) State, but right now, right
here in the realm of the queen and just some clicks away from your mailbox.  
  
MC OG is a rare indica dominant hybrid (80% indica/20% sativa) strain created
through crossing the classic Master Chef X OG Kush strains. This hard to find
bud brings on a fresh flavor and a long-lasting high that's perfect for
kicking back at the end of a long and stressful day. MC OG buds have a flavor
that is sweet and lemony on the inhale with a woody pine exhale that's a
little spicy and tangy. The aroma is very earthy and pungent with a rotting
spicy wood overtone that can be a little heavy at times. The MC OG high hits
both mind and body with a high level of potency. You'll feel an energetic
onset that zaps through your body a few minutes after your last hit, launching
you into a state of almost frenzied euphoria. This effect quickly takes a
downward turn, dropping you into a deep and heady relaxation that leaves you
slightly stoned and pretty spacey. You'll soon find yourself distant and
fading in and out of sedation in this state. Thanks to these effects and its
high 19-21% average THC level, MC OG is often chosen to treat conditions such
as chronic fatigue, depression, headaches or migraines, nausea, and chronic
pain. This bud has round small bright neon green nugs with golden undertones,
bright orange haris, and a coating of chunky amber crystal trichomes.
