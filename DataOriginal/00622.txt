thc-hydra 9.3 Shows how easy it would be to gain unauthorized access to a
system  
  
  
What is hydra ??  
THC Hydra stands for The hackers choice Hydra.  
  
This a hacking tool, it is a very powerful password cracking tool. I think you
may come across the john the ripper tool, even this tool is used for password
cracking.  
  
The difference between John the ripper and the hacker choice hydra is John the
ripper works offline and The hackers choice hydra (Hydra) works online.  
  
Number one of the biggest security holes are passwords, as every password
security study shows. This tool is a proof of concept code, to give
researchers and security consultants the possibility to show how easy it would
be to gain unauthorized access from remote to a system. There are already
several login hacker tools available, however, none does either support more
than one protocol to attack or support parallelized connects. It was tested to
compile cleanly on Linux, Windows/Cygwin, Solaris, FreeBSD/OpenBSD, QNX
(Blackberry 10) and MacOS. However the module engine for new services is very
easy so it won't take a long time until even more services are supported. Via
the command line options you specify which logins to try, which passwords, if
SSL should be used, how many parallel tasks to use for attacking, etc.
PROTOCOL is the protocol you want to use for attacking, e.g. ftp, smtp, http-
get or many others are available.  
  
Features  
For researchers and security consultants  
This tool is for legal purposes only  
It was tested to compile cleanly on Linux, Windows/Cygwin, Solaris,
FreeBSD/OpenBSD, QNX (Blackberry 10) and MacOS.  
Currently this tool supports several protocols  
If you want the ssh module, you have to setup libssh (not libssh2!) on your
system  
Supports mobile systems based on Linux, MacOS or QNX  
  
you will learn what is thc-hydra and how does it work and also you will learn
all the commands in the tool.
