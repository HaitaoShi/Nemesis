Description  
Indications:  
  
Valium is used to treat anxiety disorders and also used as treatment of
symptoms of alcohol withdrawal such as hallucinations, tremors, agitation,
delirium, and seizures. For neurologic disorders, it is used to treat seizures
and relief of muscle spasms.  
How to take:  
  
The usual oral Valium dose is 2-10 mg given 2-4 times daily. Patients with
abnormal kidney function may need lower dosages of Valium as it is metabolized
by the liver and excreted in the kidneys. Valium may be taken with or without
food. For more detailed information please see label and please consult
specialist. Do not take more Valium than it is indicated at the label without
consulting your doctor.  
Precautions:  
  
Valium should not be used for lactating and nursing women since it is excreted
in breast milk and can affect nursing infants. Common side effects of Valium
are loss of balance, exhaustion and lethargy. May also cause double vision,
confusion, depression, and speech problems. Moreover, prolonged use may cause
addiction. Therefore, Valium should be used under a doctor′s supervision.
