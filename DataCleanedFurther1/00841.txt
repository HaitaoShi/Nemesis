Testosterone Enanthate 300  
  
VIOGEN TESTOSTERONE ENANTHATE 300 is used in replacement therapy in conditions
associated with deficiency of endogenous testosterone. It is an oil based
injectable, designed to release testosterone slowly from the injection site.
Once administered, serum concentrations of this hormone will rise for several
days, and remain markedly elevated for approximately two weeks. For medical
purposes this is the most widely prescribed testosterone used regularly to
treat cases of hypogonadism and other disorders related to androgen
deficiency. As with all testosterone products it has a strong anabolic
activity, with a pronounced androgenic component. Significant gains in
strength and muscle tissue as well a noticeable increase in libido.
