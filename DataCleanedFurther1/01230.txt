According to legend, The CIA, the FBI, and another ultra-secret agency
concocted this strain from a slew of other exceedingly potent strains in the
1960s. After years of trial and error, a super secret sub-group of this
combination perfected their Frankenstein’s Monster around 1970 at the
University of Mississippi, only to have a sly unnamed technician steal a
sample and begin breeding it for the masses. Of course, it is highly unlikely
that any of this is true, but what a dope, dope story, huh?  
  
Only fueling the rumors further, this incredibly potent strain is also called
“Government Indica Strain 1” making the elusive truth of its origins even more
intriguing.If you love an outrageous origin story, but love a strong, long
lasting high even more, then this is a great bud to take for a test drive. G13
was bred to be the ‘perfect strain’ and comes damn close. Great flavors, great
effects, and very little effort on the smoker’s part to get a long lasting
high that’ll knock you off your feet? Check, check, and check.  
THC Content  
  
What we do know for sure is that the THC levels are eye-popping at 22% on
average with both CBD and CBN reading at 1% each. The buds are dense enough to
be considered stone-like and are light green in color with orange hairs that
make it appear almost furry. The aromas are strong and lean towards mandarin
oranges and grapefruit with flavors that are sweet and fall in the same citrus
family.
