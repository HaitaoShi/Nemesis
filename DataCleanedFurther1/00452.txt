G13, also known as G-13 and G Thirteen, is a potent indica marijuana strain
and is the subject of many urban legends. According to some accounts, the CIA,
FBI, and other agencies gathered the best strains of marijuana from breeders
all over the world. At a super-secret installation at the University of
Mississippi, they bred many new super hybrids in the late 1960s. Allegedly, a
single cutting of this plant was liberated by an unnamed technician and bred
for the masses. Although the legends are probably not true, G13 delivers
effects like no other. It has pine, earthy, and woody smell, and could expect
more unique flavors when smoking. If you have the opportunity, definitely
partake in this strain.
