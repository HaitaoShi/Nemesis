Please be aware of the difference between our products of Mix Shake and Mix
Shake(Upgraded). Please take the pictures and the introduce as the reference.
And place orders correctly for the one you exactly want. Thank you! (If you
does not find the shake listing for another type, that means it is currently
sold out and the listing is off, waiting to be restock.)  
In addition, due to the rapid batch change of Mix Shake, there is a
possibility of quality differences in each package of Mix Shake you receive.
Do NOT refer to the products you received before when placing new orders. We
will classify Mix Shake into REGULAR type and UPGRADED type, but do NOT
guarantee the absolute consistency of product quality and appearance for any
type.  
  
Our Mix Shake is UPGRADED now! This amazing upgraded Mix Shake is a mixture of
offcut ground buds powder due to buds trimming.
