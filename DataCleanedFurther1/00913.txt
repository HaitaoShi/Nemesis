10 mg THC guidance is for individuals who have established a need for a higher
dose. This guidance applies if you have already determined your most effective
dose is 10 mg THC or greater. If you intend to increase your dose, it is
recommended you do so by only 2.5 mg of THC. DO NOT increase your dose by 10
mg of THC.  
  
SPECTRUM  
Red GelTabs are THC dominant, contain little-to-no CBD and are available in
both indica and sativa.  
Blue GelTabs are balanced ratio of THC to CBD and available in hybrid.  
Yellow GelTabs are CBD dominant and available in hybrid.  
  
STRAIN  
Blackberry Kush - Indica dominant hybrid marijuana strain. It is a potent
strain and is often recommended for pain management for its strong body high
effects and the great thing about this strain is that you only need very
little of it to get high. It is very popular among both experienced and
recreational users.  
  
Sour Diesel - Sativa marijuana strain has a reputation for being one of the
most pungent strains of all time, and for good reason. It emanates an
extremely strong odor of skunk, gasoline, and lemon. It may not be one of the
tastiest strains, but it packs a punch. It has the potential to energize and
uplift, making it a solid choice for those living with mood disorders like
depression.  
  
Lemon Kush - Hybrid strain with a 50:50 sativa/indica ratio and high CBN
content. It is a blend of Afghani Kush and Lemon G with a potent lemon flavor
of its own. Its taste can be credited to the high amounts of Limonene found
within the strain.
