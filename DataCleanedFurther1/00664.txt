Yes 3000mg  
  
Believe POPS these are probably the strongest vapes you will find.
Stupendously strong, these will have you sitting on your backside within a few
pulls. Ensure that you use a high quality vape pen such as SMOK to ensure an
even vapor. If you are a hard stoner and you still need to be discreet this is
highly recommended. Literally the ability to get high anywhere without the
worry of wandering eyes and whiffing noses.

Is the description still up to date - meaning do you only ship this to UK, not
EU?

How safe is your product? I'm thinking of buying from you in the future but I
need products that I know are SAFE 100 percent.
