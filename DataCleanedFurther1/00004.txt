KALASHNIKOV AUTOFLOWERING:  
  
AN AUTO SUPERSTAR  
  
Kalashnikov Autoflowering is another great auto cannabis variety. The original
Kalashnikov is already renowned for its superior genetics, and this auto
version is no different.  
  
With roughly 15% THC, this strain boasts plenty of potency without going
overboard. It produces a well-balanced high that combines a strong euphoria
with a nice, consistent body buzz. It is a great strain for social occasions,
generally leaving users feeling elated, social, and happy. Be careful, however
- this strain is known to cause couchlock in large doses. Remember that they
call the original Kalashnikov the "One hit wonder", as it might knock a newbie
smoker out on the first big puff.  
  
Being an auto, Kalashnikov Autoflowering is very easy to grow. It reaches very
manageable heights of roughly 100cm and is well suited for both indoor and
outdoor environments. It is slightly sativa dominant, yet flowers in just 9-10
weeks, at which point you’ll be rewarded with some top-shelf buds.
