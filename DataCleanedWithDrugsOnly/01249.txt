Purple Haze is a sativa marijuana strain popularized by Jimi Hendrix’s 1967
classic song, Purple Haze. This strain delivers a dreamy burst of euphoria
that brings veteran consumers back to their psychedelic heyday. This nostalgic
sativa staple remains cherished for its high energy cerebral stimulation that
awakens creativity and blissful contentment throughout the day. Purple Haze is
believed to have descended from parent strains Purple Thai and Haze, which
pass on a mix of sweet and earthy flavors underscored by notes of berry and
sharp spice. Purple Haze buds typically acquire vibrant hues of lavender that
further justify the naming of this strain.
Refund policy
If your order doesn't show up we can offer you 50% reship or refund of the
original order.  
For years we used to reship 100% of the orders but unfortunately we live in a
world where people take advantage of you and sometimes our clients lie when it
comes to receiving orders. Please understand that we are here for money and we
feel sorry that honnest men/women have to suffer the loss. Besides, you are
buying weed, not vegetables. :)
