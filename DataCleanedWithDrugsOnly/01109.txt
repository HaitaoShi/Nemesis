Diazepam, first marketed as Valium, is a medicine of the benzodiazepine family
that typically produces a calming effect. It is commonly used to treat a range
of conditions including anxiety, alcohol withdrawal syndrome, benzodiazepine
withdrawal syndrome, muscle spasms, seizures, trouble sleeping, and restless
legs syndrome. It may also be used to cause memory loss during certain medical
procedures. It can be taken by mouth, inserted into the rectum, injected into
muscle, or injected into a vein. When given into a vein, effects begin in one
to five minutes and last up to an hour. By mouth, effects may take 40 minutes
to begin.
