Want to know how to start a riot? Yep. Make moonshine? Sure. Beat a lie
detector test? Who couldn’t use a little more danger in their life? A little
more edge? A little more fun? This book helps you get it all.  
  
Thanks to this book I know now how to stage a coup, make moonshine, hack coke
machine and cheat a parking meter.  
  
Most people live a rather simple life, which means that the cops aren't
chasing you for your illegal stash of drugs, or loan sharks knocking on your
door. with this book, you live your life dangerously and to the maximum, you
wanna know how to kill zombies?, well then flip to the first page. wanna know
how to make an atomic bomb?, flip to the 12th page. This book will make you
like living dangerously.
