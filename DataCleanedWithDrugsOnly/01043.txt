Tramadol, sold under the brand name Ultram among others, is an opioid pain
medication used to treat moderate to moderately severe pain. When taken by
mouth in an immediate-release formulation, the onset of pain relief usually
begins within an hour. It is also available by injection. It is available in
combination with paracetamol (acetaminophen).  
  
As is typical of opioids, common side effects include constipation, itchiness,
and nausea. Serious side effects may include hallucinations, seizures,
increased risk of serotonin syndrome, decreased alertness, and drug addiction.
A change in dosage may be recommended in those with kidney or liver problems.
It is not recommended in those who are at risk of suicide or in those who are
pregnant. While not recommended in women who are breastfeeding, those who take
a single dose should not generally stop breastfeeding. Tramadol is converted
in the liver to O-desmethyltramadol (desmetramadol), an opioid with a stronger
affinity to the μ-opioid receptor. Tramadol is also a serotonin–norepinephrine
reuptake inhibitor (SNRI).
