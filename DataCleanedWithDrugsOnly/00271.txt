Durban Poison DP I 28.2 Percent THC  
  
Product Description:  
This pure sativa originates from the South African port city of Durban. It has
gained popularity worldwide for its sweet smell and energetic, uplifting
effects. Durban Poison is the perfect strain to help you stay productive
through a busy day, when exploring the outdoors, or to lend a spark of
creativity. Growers and concentrate enthusiasts will both enjoy the over-sized
resin glands which make this strain a quality choice for concentrate
extraction. The buds are round and chunky, and leave a thick coating of
trichomes on almost all areas of the plant.
