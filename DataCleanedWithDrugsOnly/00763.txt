Please note: Basically SMALL buds, but still effective. If you mind it, or
pursue large buds, please do not place an order for this strain. Thank you!  
  
***To celebrate the recent legalization of cannabis in Thailand, we have stocked up on this exotic and rare variety, and are glad to offer incredible surprising low prices. Hope you guys enjoy it! Cheers!***  
  
Thai refers to a cannabis variety that grows natively in Thailand and was
brought to the U.S. in the 70s and 80s. Thai strain is a pure Sativa landrace
famous for its cerebral effects, flavors, and weighty heritage. This pure
sativa landrace is sometimes called Thai Sticks because of the way its buds
are traditionally dried and tied into long sticks. This original Thai variety
has given rise to many strains we commonly see on the market today, including
Voodoo, Juicy Fruit, and the classic Haze.  
  
Thai induces powerful but comfortable effects and has a distinct earthy,
woody, tobacco aroma. But when you smoke, there is another feature of this
kush is providing kind of fruity and citrusy smell, with a noticeable fuel
undertone. When inhaling, the smoke produces a very sharp, acidic taste, which
induces coughing. At the same time, it leaves herbal and floral aftertaste on
the exhale. It is not the most sensible choice for novices because the smoke
is harsh, and if the tolerance is low, it might cause anxiety.  
  
Its high is known to calm the mind and create a state of euphoria. It will
help elevate energy levels, so can be consumed throughout the day to help
complete tasks. It will keep the mind clear and fatigue at bay while lowering
stress levels.
