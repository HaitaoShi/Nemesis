Sour Diesel, also known as "Sour D" and "Sour Deez," is a popular sativa
marijuana strain made by crossing Chemdawg and Super Skunk. Sour Diesel
effects are dreamy, cerebral, fast-acting and energizing. This strain features
a pungent flavor profile that smells like diesel. Medical marijuana patients
choose Sour Diesel to help relieve symptoms associated with depression, pain,
and stress. Growers say this strain grows best in a dry, outdoor climate and
has a flowering time of 77 days. Fun fact: Sour Diesel first became popular in
the early 1990s and has been legendary ever since.
