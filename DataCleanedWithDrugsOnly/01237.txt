Runtz, Reportedly a cross of Zkittlez and Gelato #33. This strain has a
distinctly tropical, sugary scent that makes it smell more like candy than
weed. Those smells that resemble a freshly chopped fruit salad come from the
buds terpenes, the compounds that also contribute to the strains flavor and
potentially its seriously heavy heady effect.
