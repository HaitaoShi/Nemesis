“Thrilling . . . one of the best Stephen King novels not written by the master
himself. . . . The setup promises furious action, and Percy delivers, like
Richard Matheson, like King. . . An awfully impressive literary
performance.”—New York Times Book Review  
  
“Masterful crafting . . . a horror story for our times.”—Minneapolis Star
Tribune  
  
The Dark Net is real. An anonymous and often criminal arena that exists in the
secret far reaches of the Web, some use it to manage Bitcoins, pirate movies
and music, or traffic in drugs and stolen goods. And now, an ancient darkness
is gathering there as well. This force is threatening to spread virally into
the real world unless it can be stopped by members of a ragtag crew, including
a twelve-year-old who has been fitted with a high-tech visual prosthetic to
combat her blindness; a technophobic journalist; a one-time child evangelist
with an arsenal in his basement; and a hacker who believes himself a soldier
of the Internet.  
Set in present-day Portland, The Dark Net is a cracked-mirror version of the
digital nightmare we already live in, a timely and wildly imaginative techno-
thriller about the evil that lurks in real and virtual spaces, and the power
of a united few to fight back.  
  
“This is horror literature’s bebop, bold, smart, confident in its capacity to
redefine its genre from the ground up. Read this book, but take a firm grip on
your hat before you start.”—Peter Straub
