OG Kush Strain 28g POTENT GRADE  
  
THC: 19% - 24%, CBN: 1%  
OG Kush is an American marijuana classic, a Southern California original with
some of the highest THC levels in the world. With a 25:75 sativa/indica ratio,
this strain pulls no punches. Expect a hard, mixed high with intense euphoria
followed by serious couch-lock. The plant's THC concentration can reach levels
as high as 19-24%. That just 1 percentage point less than the current record-
holder. The cerebral boost from OG Kush is ideal for depression, bipolar
disorder, and anxiety, while the heavy body high can help with pain and
nausea. OG Kush is also used to treat Alzheimer's disease. Dry mouth and eyes
are the most common negative effects, though headaches and paranoia are also
possible. This strain is a hybrid, probably a descendant of a female Chemdawg
plant and a male Hindu Kush plant. OG Kush, which has given rise to countless
West Coast strains, has an earthy, wood taste and a strong pine scent. It's
most popular in California, the Pacific Northwest, and Colorado.
