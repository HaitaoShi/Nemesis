Crystal Coma is a rare sativa-dominant hybrid from California that induces
deep, trance-like effects. With THC testing up to a whopping 30% and taking
3rd place in the 2014 High Times Cannabis cup for Best Sativa.  
  
Crystal Coma is the kind of strain you want to try when you have an evening
free from any responsibilities. The air is filled with a pungent cheese and
skunk odor when you break apart the buds. As the nugget crumbled, the diesel
fuel fumes release into the air. Users report that as the first hit was
released, the old cheese and skunk taste turned into a spicy tingle on the end
of the tongue while the brain ascended three octaves higher. This is the type
of strain to exercise caution with and be mindful of moderation. This strain
is known to make the body become slightly numb and tingly as well as warm and
comfortable. Surprisingly, the consumers altered minds were still able to
remain calm and peaceful. Thoughts seemed to float around from one lucid
daydream to another. Crystal Coma is not for the novice user.
