SUPER LEMON HAZE  
  
All products need to be highlighted, some of them don`t as they talk for
themselves once tested.  
  
40/60 Stativa Dominant Hybrid -40% Indica / 60% Sativa  
THC 25%  
Level - 9/10  
  
Super Lemon Haze is undoubtedly special. This Cannabis Cup winner is a cross
between Lemon Skunk and Super Silver Haze, meaning this strain is all
pedigree, and righteously toted as one of the best sativas available in
today’s market.  
  
This sativa-dominant hybrid truly embodies its name, boasting of a sharp
lemony aroma, that tastes as good as it smells. Super Lemon Haze’s onset
creates a strong euphoric high that will make you want to jump out of your
chair for joy. This strain is also a popular medical variety, with a long list
of ailments that it can successfully help ease.
Refund policy
If your order doesn't show up we can offer you 50% reship or refund of the
original order.  
For years we used to reship 100% of the orders but unfortunately we live in a
world where people take advantage of you and sometimes our clients lie when it
comes to receiving orders. Please understand that we are here for money and we
feel sorry that honnest men/women have to suffer the loss. Besides, you are
buying weed, not vegetables. :)
