A bit of background on me:  
I’m a former employee of one of the ’big four’ banks in the U.S. I worked in
the credit/debit card fraud  
department, and I had no knowledge of carding previous to my employment. Most
of my carding  
knowledge comes from the inside, and so I’m still learning heaps of important
things from this side of  
the business.  
First and foremost, I want to outline exactly what my roles and
responsibilities were.  
I was in charge of reviewing credit and debit card accounts with ’suspicious’
activity flagged on them.  
When a card gets flagged, it’s because the transaction attempted has a fraud
score of over 300.....  
  
Anyways, this is an 11 page pdf
