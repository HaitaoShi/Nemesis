Amnesia Haze has a somewhat misleading name: it's a sativa-dominant hybrid
that, despite its potency, won't leave you with a severely impaired memory.
Composed from a cross of staple strain Haze and several different worldwide
landraces, including Thai, Hawaiian, and Afghani, Amnesia Haze may actually
drive inspiration rather than forgetfulness. The Afghani indica in its
genetics makes for a well-balanced, albeit somewhat cerebral high.  
  
Phenotypes of Amnesia Haze can vary, with some playing host to more cloudy
white trichomes than others; psychoactive potency can also vary in these
cases. The unique size of the strain buds is matched by a unique scent and
taste. The flowers immediately present a lemony tang that is mellowed out by
some earthiness. Notes of wood, especially cedar, are evident in the buds.
Breaking open the buds gives off a faint spicy scent, which may be familiar to
fans of other strains in the Haze family. Despite all this richness, smoke is
smooth when inhaled. The taste, both immediately and when exhaled, is again
typical of Haze strains, with a spicy and citrus-infected flavor. This can be
a pungent strain, and the smell of smoke may linger.
