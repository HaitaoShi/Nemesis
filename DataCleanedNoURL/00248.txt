MOBILedit you can connect your phone via cable, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi or through
our mobile app, which is available for many different platforms. You will then
be able to view the entire contents of your phone and synchronize, add, edit
or delete anything you’d like.With so much important data in your phone it is
essential to have a professional tool to maximize what your phone can do for
you. The use of a PC keyboard makes all the difference when you’re adding new
contacts to your phonebook, managing files or sending text messages.  
  
Features:  
  
\- Feel free to manually edit or delete contacts by tapping on your phone, but
it’s annoying and tedious. Imagine a tool that allows quick and convenient
management of your contacts from the comfort of your PC. With MOBILedit you
can full-text search, choose different views, link or unlink contacts between
different accounts (for example Exchange, Gmail, Facebook,local) or use the
built-in Contacts Optimizer which removes all your duplicates and
intelligently fixes many other possible issues with only a few clicks.  
\- Don’t buy and carry another USB flash drive. Your phone can be your
personal storage. MOBILedit lets you drag & drop documents, photos, videos and
music between a PC and your phone so you can enjoy them whether you are at
home, at work or on the go.  
\- Annoyed with unclear iTunes syncing? With MOBILedit you can browse the
media files on any iOS device in the same familiar and straightforward way you
would with Windows Explorer. You can copy photos, videos, ringtones, notes and
other files between phone and PC. For advanced users there is access to phone
application data files and system files, so you can even fix issues related to
the original firmware.  
\- Backing up is an essential to-do for everyone. But many people don’t
realize it until after the loss of their phone. Now it doesn’t have to be like
that. With MOBILedit, it’s so easy to create a backup of all the valuable data
in your phone because it’s done for you – The backup is made automatically
while you are browsing your data and you can find it later in the Offline
folder. Also you can back up to our cloud based service Internet Storage.
Access to these backups is available from our PC software and through our
mobile applications for iPhone and Android. This allows for easy migration of
your valuable contacts and messages.  
\- Different phones require many different tools in order to connect to your
PC. But with MOBILedit, you can easily manage almost any type of phone.
MOBILedit is a unique and universal tool that supports phones with any system,
such as Android, iPhone, Blackberry, Windows Phone, Bada, Symbian and Meego in
addition to many feature phones including even those that are practically
obsolete.  
\- Our Smart Contacts Optimizer guides you through a step-by-step process
which creates a perfect set of contacts. It works for local contacts as well
as all synchronized contacts such as Exchange or Google. Optimizer fixes
invalid, duplicate or similar contacts. It also finds missing contacts in a
user’s messages and missed calls to allow you to add them as well. It also
allows users to merge partial contacts and enhance phone numbers into
international formats making it easy to call while abroad. Also, the Facebook
Photo Match makes it easy to assign a picture to your contacts from Facebook.
The entire optimization process is a combination of mathematics and know-how
that brings users surprisingly useful results.
