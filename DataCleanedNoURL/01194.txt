🫐 🥮🫐 Blueberry Muffin 🫐 🥮 🫐  
Indica Dominant Hybrid - 80% Indica / 20% Sativa THC: 21%  
  
Recently on a sunny farm in the Golden (Stoner) State, but right now, right
here in the realm of the queen and just some clicks away from your mailbox.  
  
Blueberry Muffin, also known as the plural “Blueberry Muffins,” is a tasty
indica dominant hybrid strain created through crossing the infamous Purple
Panty Dropper with the addictive Blueberry strain. The result is a bud that
packs lifting effects and an insanely delicious flavor that is said to be just
like a fresh blueberry muffin! The smell isn't something to sneeze at either –
Blueberry Muffin has a rich frosty aroma of fresh berries and earth with a
touch of nutty vanilla that becomes slightly pungent as the nugs are burned.
The Blueberry Muffin high is just as delectable as the taste, with full-bodied
effects that are perfect for any indica or hybrid lover. You'll feel the
cerebral onset first as your mind lifts into hazy bliss that is soon wiped
away and replaced with a mild sense of focus. As you start to become aware of
random things around you, your body will start to feel tingly and numb as a
body high makes its way from head to toe. These long-lasting effects in
combination with its moderate THC level make Blueberry Muffin the perfect
choice for killing the effects of chronic pain, anxiety or stress, nausea, and
headaches or migraines. This bud has dense and heavy forest green nugs with
bluish undertones, dark orange hairs, and a few scattered amber crystal
trichomes.
