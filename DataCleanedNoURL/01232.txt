Greenhouse cannabis combines the benefits of outdoor growing with those of
indoor cultivation. It offers better quality than outdoor cannabis and lower
prices than indoor cannabis.  
Please note that greenhouse weeds can not be compared to indoor weeds. There
is no doubt that this product is still great quality for its favorable price.
However, if you prefer top shelf indoor quality buds, we recommend you choose
our indoor products which can be found in our other product listings.  
  
Lemon Kush, also known as Cali Lemon Kush, is a hybrid marijuana strain. The
distinct smell and taste of the well-balanced hybrid (50/50) cannabis strain
Lemon Kush is a potent lemony zest that smells refreshing and tastes both sour
and sweet. It is actually a blend of Afghani Kush and Lemon G with a potent
lemon flavor of its own. Its buds are light green with patches of yellow
accompanied.  
  
Its THC levels average at 20% with a high of 26%, making Lemon Kush an
extremely potent strain. Its high is known to induce a couch-lock effect while
energizing ones cerebral activity and creativity. It causes the consumers
spirits to lift while eliminating physical aches throughout the body, with
reviewers stating the sativa and indica effects go well together and balance
one another out. This strain is useful for consuming in the afternoon or
evening, so long as physical activity is not going to be a part of your day.
Lemon Kush is the perfect solution for when the stresses of life have you
feeling sour.
