If you have any question feel free to send me a message
Refund policy
\- Send me a message before opening dispute, Im willing to solve any issue
between vendor and buyer  
\- Before opening dispute and logins are invalid you must send checking time
and attach IP And Login screenshot as a proof. Both must show full desktop
screenshot. Any claim without any of these will be rejected as there is no
proof that the password is changed or account block  
\- Sometimes logs may come with less or more balance than what I advertised.  
This will always happen because it's an active and functional account that
belongs to a REAL PERSON and this person is still using his own account for
personal purposes.  
Dont open dispute if this is your case. Thanks!

If you have a good setup to avoid any red flag WellsF wont ask you for otp
code and youll be able to login successfully  
If they ask for otp that means they noticed inusual activity.
