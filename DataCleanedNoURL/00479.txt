ANTI DETECT BROWSER  
  
Anti detect is perhaps considered the best and secure browser in the world
because of its many features including;  
  
BROWSER FINGERPRINT  
  
WHAT IS A BROWSER FINGERPRINT?  
  
  
Browsing fingerprinting is a term used to describe the collection of data to
give a user, or client, a unique identifier. A simple example of data used to
create unique fingerprints would be a user agent string. This data is often
included in fullz profiles.  
  
However, a browser fingerprint is not at all limited to user agent strings!
This is just one of many unique identifiers that can and will affect your
transactions.  
  
HOW DO WEBSITES USE FINGERPRINT  
  
Other variables such as Flash version, keyboard layout, language settings,
MIME settings, time zone, OS version, browser extensions, screen resolution,
and many others are collected and organized to build profiles to verify the
authenticity of returning users. Companies such as MaxMind, SAS, and ProScore
sell these as Predictive Analysis Decision models.  
  
it takes all of this into account and helps you quickly modify, customize,
import and export your settings to better match your card holder profiles.  
  
WHAT DOES ANTI-DETECT DO?  
  
simple : antidetect browser is able to clone /copy any browser details such
flash , browser version , name , ip address , mac address , installed add-ons
and many other parameters  
that means you will be able to clone any details of the browser used by the
user you want to card and the target ted sites will think this is the legit
user and will not block your carding attempt  
  
Anti detect browser cost more than 300$ when you purchase it.  
  
FRAUD FOX  
  
Fraudfox is a Virtual Machine based on VMWare.  
  
VMWare is software that mimics another computer’s setup the VM stands for
Virtual Machine.  
  
For instance you can use VMWare on a Mac laptop and run it up so that you have
a Windows desktop running inside of your Mac environment giving you access to
use programs and features that only Windows employs.  
  
FraudFox has the ability to spoof not only the operating system requirements
of a machine but also the browser fingerprint that you are using also...
