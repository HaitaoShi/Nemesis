Oreoz, also known a "Oreo Cookies" and "Oreos," is a potent hybrid marijuana
strain made by crossing Cookies and Cream with Secret Weapon. This strain
produces a long-lasting and relaxing high. Consumers should take caution as
the high potency of Oreoz may be overwhelming to those new to cannabis. Buds
are all dense and very flavorful as it produces a very sweet aroma. During the
smoke it has notes of fruits mainly orange with a tinge of biscuit and the
strain is very gassy.
