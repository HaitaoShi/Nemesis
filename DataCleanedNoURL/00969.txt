EM RAT ( Eagle Monitor Remote Access Transmission ) is a very Fast,
lightweight & easily customizable remote access tool written in C#.  
Consider this as an upgrade of HorusEyesRat which was written in VB.NET.  
  
From the original Eagle Monitor - This reborn version has been re-coded,
reworked and scripted.  
What has been changed? Well to start off...

A self hosted and intergrated stub builder  
Automation tasks & Mass tasks  
Memory execution

What's new features that were added in that you wont find in the original
software ?

Keylogger & Clipboard monitor (offline and realtime)  
Network information (IPV4)  
Client can now be written in BOTH in VB and C#  
An installer for a more professional deployment & delivery
