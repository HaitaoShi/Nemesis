BTC stealer substitution of a BTC wallet in the buffer. Found it on a
hillock.  
Replaces the wallet with yours, which you specify in the build.  
Craftsmen can organize autoloading and loader.  
  
The thing is very cool, he himself somehow got bogged down on this,
transferred 0.007 BTC to someone.  
The essence lies in the attentiveness of the person, think for yourself, at
least once manually entered wallet?  
Copied pasted and forgot, here and there it was the same, copied, pasted and
fucked up the money.  
On this you can get a good profit, especially for those who know how to
properly spread the virus.
