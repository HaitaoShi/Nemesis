Hybrid - 50% Sativa /50% Indica  
  
THC: 14% - 18%, CBD: 2%  
  
Like its fellow Orange cousins, this sativa-dominant hybrid has a distinct
orange flavor and aroma, with sweet hints of lemon. It's a crossbreed of
Orange Crush and Blue Dream, both very popular strains in their own rights.
The THC levels in this strain are relatively high, hitting 18% in some tests.
CBD levels are also strong, at least relative to most other popular strains:
Between 2% and 3%. That means Orange Dream can be a useful treatment for
seizure disorders and other conditions that respond to CBD.  
  
The exact ratio of sativa to indica is unknown, however. As a sativa, Orange
Dream delivers a euphoric, upbeat punch with a strong dose of creativity and
contrasting feelings of laziness. This strain can be used to treat anxiety,
mood disorders, lack of appetite, and chronic pain. Dry mouth and dry eyes are
relatively common, but other adverse effects are more rare. Orange Crush is an
ideal choice for busy days and social situations, as it provides a spirited
boost of energy.
