Hello. I only ship to Australia at buyers own risk.  
Customs in your country are doing a better job then EU Customs...  
(witch is NOT always so nice...)  
We do see orders getting through more often then a couple of years ago, but we
just can't guarantee the 99% arrival standard as within Europe..  
  
Cheers mate! Stay Safe
