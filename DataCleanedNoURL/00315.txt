What Is Rosin  
\------------------------------  
  
Items needed to make rosin include dried cannabis flower, a hair straightening
iron, a metal tool, and wax paper  
Rosin refers to an extraction process that utilizes a combination of heat and
pressure to nearly instantaneously squeeze resinous sap from your initial
starting material. The term “rosin” originated as a method of making a product
used to create friction with violin bows. With cannabis, this method is
incredibly versatile in that it can either be used with flowers or to clean up
hash and kief into a full-melt hash oil. The result is a translucent, sappy,
and sometimes shatter-like product. If executed correctly, rosin can rival the
flavor, potency, and yield of other solvent-based extraction products.  
  
Why Is Rosin So Popular?

One reason for rosin’s newfound popularity is that it’s a solventless
technique, meaning the process does not require use of any foreign substances.
Instead, rosin uses a mechanical process involving heat and pressure to
extract the resin from the plant. Other extraction methods utilize light
hydrocarbons such as butane and/or propane. Often, these complex and
mechanical systems require a lengthy purge to safely remove most, if not all
of the residual solvents from the final product.  
  
Rosin, on the other hand, simply uses heat and pressure and does not require
any additional cleaning, so your final product is clean and ready in just
minutes. When compared to BHO (butane hash oil), the two are aesthetically
indistinguishable. Rosin, when made properly, retains just as many valuable
terpenes that account for aroma and flavor. However, in a lab test, rosin will
never contain a single parts per million (PPM) of residual hydrocarbon. In
other words, you are essentially getting shatter without any solvents when us
