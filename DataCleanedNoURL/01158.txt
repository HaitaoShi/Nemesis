We sell 100% pure Ketamine S-Isomer shards.  
  
It still the same product as our white shards however some batches turned
brown when converting the powder to shards.  
  
If you have heard of ketamine, it is probably for its history of abuse as a
club drug. But it could also be one of the biggest breakthroughs in treating
severe depression in years.  
  
How can one drug hold such promise and peril? The answer lies in how it
affects your brain.  
  
Ketamine works like a flash mob, temporarily taking over a certain chemical
receptor. In some cases and with expert medical care, that can be a good
thing. But cross that line, and it is big trouble.  
  
Your doctor probably will not give it to you as an antidepressant yet.
Scientists are still testing it for that.  
  
Ketamine got its start as an anesthesia medicine in the 1960s. It was used on
the battlefields of the Vietnam War.  
  
At lower doses, it can help ease pain. Ketamine helps sedatives work and may
help people need fewer addictive painkillers, like morphine after surgery or
while caring for burns.  
  
When misused, ketamine can change your sense of sight and sound. You can have
hallucinations and feel out of touch with your surroundings – and even from
yourself. It can make it hard to speak or move, and it has been abused as a
date-rape drug.
