There is a new Two-factor authentication loophole in every system that gives
carders an opportunity exploit payment processor.  
  
We discovered 2fa vulnerabilities in numerous banks and account - ranging from
dangerous exploits that can allow anyone to bypass their two-factor
authentication, to being able to send malicious code through their SmartChat
system Below, we go over each vulnerability in detail and why we believe they
are so dangerous.  
  
With this method you can bypass any account or bank phone or email
verification, which for ease of terminology we can call two-factor
authentication. Their Two-factor, is normally triggered when a user logs into
their account from a new device, location or IP address.  
What is 2FA authentication?  
  
2FA is a security system that requires two distinct forms of identification in
order to access something. Two-factor authentication can be used to strengthen
the security of an online account, a smartphone, or even a door.  
How to bypass any bank or account Two-factor?  
  
Benefits of bypassing 2fa  
  
Stolen logs credentials are very cheap on the black market. Essentially, it is
exactly because it is so difficult to get into people bank or accounts with
stolen credentials that these stolen credentials are so cheap. Bank and
various account outflow is set up to detect and block suspicious login
attempts, usually related to a new device or IP, besides other suspicious
actions. But with our 2FA bypass method, that security measure is null and
void. Carders can buy stolen credentials in bulk, log in with those
credentials, bypass 2FA in minutes, and have complete access to those
accounts. With many known and unknown stolen credentials on the market, this
is potentially a huge loss for many customers.
Refund policy
Please understand I am not here to hold your hand through this. Ultimately you
are responsible for your own setup and your own method. All items especially
card details are checked and confirmed live before being shipped out to you.
Replacements/refunds outside the day you actually received and attempted to
use the goods will not be permitted. Due to my strict checking policy I will
only offer a replacement or refund under the following conditions:  
  
1.Same day return - If you believe the card is dead and keeps declining on
your method message me as soon as possible. Replacement time is 2 hours and
you need to provide cc checker result before getting replacement or refund.  
  
2.Only finalized orders are considered received. Return window is 24h from
finalization date/time. 3.Burden of proof. Please submit link to a screenshot
showing the card declining on netflix or other popular free trial websites. I
will also accept luxchecker results if you prefer. *** If you send me a
message 3 days after I ship your order complaining that the card is dead and I
see you still have not finalized consider any refund/reship policy null and
void. All returns (even the stupid ones) will be handled on a case to case
basis to ensure customer satisfaction.  
  
4\. Triggering the security features during a login attempt is not a reason
for a replacement. This only happens on your end. I have no control over this.
If your system is not prepared efficiently before your login attempt you have
a very good chance of triggering the security feature. If you do not know how
to do this contact me politely and i will gladly help you for free.
