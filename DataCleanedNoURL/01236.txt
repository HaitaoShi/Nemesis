White Widow effects are mostly energizing.  
not at allvery high  
  
White Widow potency is higher than average.  
  
Among the most famous strains worldwide is White Widow, a balanced hybrid
first bred in the Netherlands by Green House Seeds. A cross between a
Brazilian sativa landrace and a resin-heavy South Indian indica, White Widow
has blessed every Dutch coffee shop menu since its birth in the 1990s. Its
buds are white with crystal resin, warning you of the potent effects to come.
A powerful burst of euphoria and energy breaks through immediately,
stimulating both conversation and creativity. White Widow’s genetics have
given rise to many other legends like White Russian, White Rhino, and Blue
Widow. Still, many growers prefer cultivation of the original White Widow,
which flowers in about 60 days indoors.
